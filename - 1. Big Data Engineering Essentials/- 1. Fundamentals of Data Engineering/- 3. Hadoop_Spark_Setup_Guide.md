# 🚀 Easy Guide to Setting Up Hadoop and Spark on Your Computer

## 📘 Introduction

Want to start your journey with big data tools like **Hadoop** and **Spark**? Great! This guide will walk you through how to install them on your **Windows** or **Ubuntu** system in **simple, human-friendly steps**. Whether you're just starting out or want to practice hands-on, this setup will prepare your machine for learning and building cool data projects.

## 🤔 Why Install Hadoop and Spark?

Imagine you want to:
- Track weather data from hundreds of sensors
- Build a fraud detection system for online payments
- Analyze tweets in real-time

To do that, you need tools that can handle **huge amounts of data** fast. That's where Hadoop and Spark come in:
- **Hadoop** stores and processes large files in chunks
- **Spark** processes data **super-fast** using memory instead of slow hard drives

Hands-on practice helps you understand how things work — and that’s the best way to learn!

## ✅ Prerequisites (Things You Need First)
Before we install Hadoop and Spark, make sure you have:

- **Java JDK** (needed to run both Hadoop and Spark)
- **Python** (makes using Spark easier — especially if you’re a beginner)

Let’s go step by step for each OS.

# 🪟 For Windows Users:

### 1️⃣ Install Java (JDK)
1. Search "Download JDK for Windows" on Google
2. Go to the **official Oracle website**
3. Download the latest JDK version
4. Install it to a folder like `C:\Java\JDK`
5. To check if it works, open **Command Prompt** and type:
```
java -version
```
If you see a version number, you're good!

### 2️⃣ Install Python
1. Visit [python.org](https://www.python.org)
2. Download the latest version
3. During install, **check the box** that says "Add Python to PATH"
4. Check it by typing in Command Prompt:
```
python --version
```

### 3️⃣ Download and Set Up Spark
1. Go to the [Spark download page](https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html)
2. Choose a version **pre-built for Hadoop 2.7**
3. Download the `.tgz` file (like a .zip)
4. Extract it to a folder like `C:\Spark`
5. Inside, go to the `bin` folder — you’ll see `pyspark` (Python shell) and `spark-shell` (Scala shell)

### 4️⃣ Setup Hadoop for Windows Compatibility
1. Search for `winutils.exe for Hadoop 2.7` on GitHub
2. Create folder: `C:\Hadoop\bin`
3. Paste `winutils.exe` inside the `bin` folder

### 5️⃣ Set Environment Variables
Do this to make Spark, Hadoop, and Java run from any folder:
1. Search for **Environment Variables** in Start Menu
2. Under **System Variables**, click **New** and add these:
   - `JAVA_HOME` → `C:\Java\JDK`
   - `HADOOP_HOME` → `C:\Hadoop`
   - `SPARK_HOME` → `C:\Spark`
   - Add Python path if needed
3. Edit the `Path` variable and **Add these**:
   - `%JAVA_HOME%\bin`
   - `%HADOOP_HOME%\bin`
   - `%SPARK_HOME%\bin`

### 6️⃣ Test Your Setup
Open Command Prompt:
- Type `spark-shell` → should open Spark's Scala shell
- Type `pyspark` → should open Python shell for Spark

🎉 You’ve installed Spark and Hadoop on Windows!

# 🐧 For Ubuntu Users:

### 1️⃣ Install Java
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk -y
java -version
```

### 2️⃣ Install Python (if not installed)
```bash
sudo apt install python3-pip -y
python3 --version
```

### 3️⃣ Install Spark
```bash
cd ~/Downloads
wget https://downloads.apache.org/spark/spark-3.4.1/spark-3.4.1-bin-hadoop2.7.tgz
mkdir ~/spark
tar -xvzf spark-3.4.1-bin-hadoop2.7.tgz -C ~/spark --strip-components 1
```

### 4️⃣ Set Environment Variables
Add these to your `~/.bashrc` file:
```bash
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64
export SPARK_HOME=~/spark
export PATH=$PATH:$SPARK_HOME/bin:$JAVA_HOME/bin
```
Apply the changes:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

### 5️⃣ Test Your Setup
```bash
spark-shell
pyspark
```

💡 If you see the Spark shell loading, you’ve done it!
